## CVE-2021-21985
 The vSphere Client (HTML5) contains a remote code execution vulnerability due to lack of input validation in the Virtual SAN Health Check plug-in which is enabled by default in vCenter Server. A malicious actor with network access to port 443 may exploit this issue to execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system that hosts vCenter Server.

## CVE-2021-21389
 BuddyPress is an open source WordPress plugin to build a community site. In releases of BuddyPress from 5.0.0 before 7.2.1 it's possible for a non-privileged, regular user to obtain administrator rights by exploiting an issue in the REST API members endpoint. The vulnerability has been fixed in BuddyPress 7.2.1. Existing installations of the plugin should be updated to this version to mitigate the issue.

## CVE-2021-1999
 Vulnerability in the Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance Kit product of Oracle Systems (component: RAS subsystems). The supported version that is affected is 8.8. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance Kit executes to compromise Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance Kit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance Kit, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance Kit accessible data. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.0 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N).

## CVE-2019-20790
 OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x, when used with pypolicyd-spf 2.0.2, allows attacks that bypass SPF and DMARC authentication in situations where the HELO field is inconsistent with the MAIL FROM field.

## CVE-2019-14907
 All samba versions 4.9.x before 4.9.18, 4.10.x before 4.10.12 and 4.11.x before 4.11.5 have an issue where if it is set with &quot;log level = 3&quot; (or above) then the string obtained from the client, after a failed character conversion, is printed. Such strings can be provided during the NTLMSSP authentication exchange. In the Samba AD DC in particular, this may cause a long-lived process(such as the RPC server) to terminate. (In the file server case, the most likely target, smbd, operates as process-per-client and so a crash there is harmless).

## CVE-2019-14902
 There is an issue in all samba 4.11.x versions before 4.11.5, all samba 4.10.x versions before 4.10.12 and all samba 4.9.x versions before 4.9.18, where the removal of the right to create or modify a subtree would not automatically be taken away on all domain controllers.

## CVE-2019-14870
 All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x before 4.11.3 have an issue, where the S4U (MS-SFU) Kerberos delegation model includes a feature allowing for a subset of clients to be opted out of constrained delegation in any way, either S4U2Self or regular Kerberos authentication, by forcing all tickets for these clients to be non-forwardable. In AD this is implemented by a user attribute delegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated), which translates to disallow-forwardable. However the Samba AD DC does not do that for S4U2Self and does set the forwardable flag even if the impersonated client has the not-delegated flag set.

## CVE-2019-14861
 All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x before 4.11.3 have an issue, where the (poorly named) dnsserver RPC pipe provides administrative facilities to modify DNS records and zones. Samba, when acting as an AD DC, stores DNS records in LDAP. In AD, the default permissions on the DNS partition allow creation of new records by authenticated users. This is used for example to allow machines to self-register in DNS. If a DNS record was created that case-insensitively matched the name of the zone, the ldb_qsort() and dns_name_compare() routines could be confused into reading memory prior to the list of DNS entries when responding to DnssrvEnumRecords() or DnssrvEnumRecords2() and so following invalid memory as a pointer.

## CVE-2019-14847
 A flaw was found in samba 4.0.0 before samba 4.9.15 and samba 4.10.x before 4.10.10. An attacker can crash AD DC LDAP server via dirsync resulting in denial of service. Privilege escalation is not possible with this issue.

## CVE-2019-14833
 A flaw was found in Samba, all versions starting samba 4.5.0 before samba 4.9.15, samba 4.10.10, samba 4.11.2, in the way it handles a user password change or a new password for a samba user. The Samba Active Directory Domain Controller can be configured to use a custom script to check for password complexity. This configuration can fail to verify password complexity when non-ASCII characters are used in the password, which could lead to weak passwords being set for samba users, making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

## CVE-2019-11932
 A double free vulnerability in the DDGifSlurp function in decoding.c in the android-gif-drawable library before version 1.2.18, as used in WhatsApp for Android before version 2.19.244 and many other Android applications, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service when the library is used to parse a specially crafted GIF image.
