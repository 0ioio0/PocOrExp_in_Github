## CVE-2021-23410
 All versions of package msgpack are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data via the unpack function. N.B: this affects the NPM package [msgpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msgpack) only, NOT the more popular package [@msgpack/msgpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@msgpack/msgpack).

## CVE-2020-15416
 This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-9703.

## CVE-2020-0022
 In reassemble_and_dispatch of packet_fragmenter.cc, there is possible out of bounds write due to an incorrect bounds calculation. This could lead to remote code execution over Bluetooth with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-8.0 Android-8.1 Android-9 Android-10Android ID: A-143894715

## CVE-2019-11932
 A double free vulnerability in the DDGifSlurp function in decoding.c in the android-gif-drawable library before version 1.2.18, as used in WhatsApp for Android before version 2.19.244 and many other Android applications, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service when the library is used to parse a specially crafted GIF image.

## CVE-2014-6271
 GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka &quot;ShellShock.&quot;  NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

## CVE-2014-0114
 Apache Commons BeanUtils, as distributed in lib/commons-beanutils-1.8.0.jar in Apache Struts 1.x through 1.3.10 and in other products requiring commons-beanutils through 1.9.2, does not suppress the class property, which allows remote attackers to &quot;manipulate&quot; the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code via the class parameter, as demonstrated by the passing of this parameter to the getClass method of the ActionForm object in Struts 1.
