## CVE-2021-29155
 An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.x. kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. Specifically, for sequences of pointer arithmetic operations, the pointer modification performed by the first operation is not correctly accounted for when restricting subsequent operations.

## CVE-2018-7600
 Drupal before 7.58, 8.x before 8.3.9, 8.4.x before 8.4.6, and 8.5.x before 8.5.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an issue affecting multiple subsystems with default or common module configurations.

## CVE-2010-1240
 Adobe Reader and Acrobat 9.x before 9.3.3, and 8.x before 8.2.3 on Windows and Mac OS X, do not restrict the contents of one text field in the Launch File warning dialog, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick users into executing an arbitrary local program that was specified in a PDF document, as demonstrated by a text field that claims that the Open button will enable the user to read an encrypted message.
